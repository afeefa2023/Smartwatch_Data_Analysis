**Analysis**

Examining smartwatch data offers valuable insights into individuals' activity patterns and caloric expenditure. The distinct identification of the most and least active days contributes to a better comprehension of the factors influencing physical activity. The data was cleaned using pandas and visualized using seaborn and matplotlib.

**Conclusion**

Based on the examination of calorie expenditure, Tuesdays are identified as the most active days for all individuals in the dataset, whereas Sunday emerges as the least active day. This determination is based on categorizing days with the highest calorie burn as the most active and those with the fewest sedentary minutes as the least active.
